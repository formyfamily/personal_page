      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a huge game fan! I have a wide range of interests in games, including shooting games, role-playing games, strategy games, Rogue-like games, action games, and a lot, lot more. I&amp;rsquo;m not good at most of them (especially PVP games), but still receiving a lot of fun from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I have all achievements of three games on Steam: The Hollow Knight, Celeste, and Slay the Spire. I&amp;rsquo;m still striving to get more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second biggest hobby is watching movies! Especially movies from the 1970s to 2000s. Harrison Ford is my favorite actor. Hope his fifth Indiana Jone&amp;rsquo;s coming out soon. (and not be ruined like Star War sequels)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love to listen to music. Progressive Rock is my favorite genre(I know they are pretty old but still love it). My other preferences including but are not limited to classic music (Especially chorus music), EDM, new age, progressive metal, and various kinds of popular music.&lt;/p&gt;
